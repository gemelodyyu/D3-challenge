## Background


Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.


The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.


## Tasks


* Create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.


* Using the D3 techniques to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 


  * Include state abbreviations in the circles.


  * Create and situate axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
  

* Include more demographics and more risk factors (three for each axis). Place additional labels in the scatter plot and give them click events so that users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. 


* Add tooltips to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
